# The following environment variable DATABASE_URL is used by the backend,
# including the sqlx crate to verify database access patterns during development.
#
# The variables beginning with POSTGRES_* are used by the postgresql docker image.
#
# *
# * => The POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD and POSTGRES_DB variables should be included
# * in the DATABASE_URL environment variable.

#
# Note (1): When running the backend service via docker, the @localhost address is reassigned to
# the actual database service in docker-compose.yml.
#
# Note (2): If you wish to use a database server that is not running via docker (or locally),
# you'll also have to edit docker-compose.yml backend service environment
# variable named DATABASE_URL to match the external database address.

DATABASE_URL=postgres://<input user here>:<input password here>@localhost/solita-exercise

POSTGRES_USER=<input user here>
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<input password here>

# The following environment variable API_ADDRESS is used by the backend service
# during development. Format: <address>:<port>
#
# API_ADDRESS environment variable is overridden in docker-compose.yml in order
# to expose the backend service when running it via docker.
#
# Example: Bind to all available ipv4 address on the current system by using 0.0.0.0:<port>
# Example: Bind to all available addresses (including ipv6) by using [::]:<port>
API_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:3000

# Only PUBLIC_* prefixed environment variables are passed to frontend
# Note: The following address depends on the docker-compose.yml reverse proxy configuration.
PUBLIC_API_ADDRESS=http://127.0.0.1:3000/api
